/* Basic CSS file for loathsxome.

   This file produces three mostly independent styles, one for mobile
   phones, one for widescreen devices and one for printout. It is
   intended to look basic and to be easily modifiable. Whenever there
   was a choice between good looks and ease of modification, looks
   were sacrificed.  Loathsxome users don't use the default CSS
   anyway, right?

   This file are five sections. 1) A CSS reset, to override varying
   browser defaults and make the other sections easy to test.
   2) Common colours and fonts. 3) Widescreen style, mostly used by
   real computers. 4) Narrow style, mostly used by mobile phones.
   5) Printout style.

/* Section 1: CSS Reset. Do not edit this; cross-browser compatibility
   works much better if you leave this alone. Add overrides in the other
   sections (as section 2 overrides the line-height on body).

/* At this point the real style work starts. Time to discuss the
   difficult bits.

   The main problem with these styles tends to what happens between
   postings. This should come as no surprise, after all the postings
   are by far the most important aspect of a blog.

   Loathsxome creates the sequence
   <header><div.date><article><article><div.date><article><footer>
   when the blog contains one posting on its own day and two on the
   following day.

   If you want something to happen between postings, there are many
   cases. Should it happen between any two postings, or do you want to
   treat same-day postings differently from day boundaries? Should it
   happen between the header and first posting?  Between the last
   posting and footer?

   Here are some selectors to match various cases:

   article+div.date, article+article

      Use padding-top, margin-top, border-top etc. to look at the
      space between postings, excluding that near header/footer.

   article+article

      Use -top to look at the space between postings on the same day.

   article+div.date

      Use -top to look at the space between days.

   article

      Use padding-bottom etc to look at the space between postings,
      including the space between the last posting and the footer.

   If the date/article schisma creates too many problems for your
   style sheet, you can also move the date into the story (ie. move
   $fulldate from a 'html date' line in the template to a 'html story'
   line). That will give you a simpler DOM structure, but when you
   post five times in a day, Loathsxome will repeat the date. Can't
   have your cake and eat it.

/* Section 3: Widescreen style. */

/* This is for devices whose screen is so wide enough to accommodate a
   full line (about 35-40 characters), typically biggish tablets,
   laptops and desktops. A desktop monitor is MUCH too wide for 40

   there's space for about 50 characters.  */

   there, and sets big fonts on the headlinery.

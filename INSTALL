Installation instructions
-------------------------

1. Copy loathsxome.cgi to somewhere on your web server where it can be
   executed. Let us assume that you make it accessible at the URL
   <http://example.org/despot/loathsxome.cgi>

2. Optional: You can avoid exposing "loathsxome.cgi" in URLs with some
   help from Apache (other web servers will provide different ways to
   accomplish the same effect).

   Suppose you want to publish <http://example.org/despot/journal>. If
   you have access to httpd.conf, you could do something like this:

       ScriptAliasMatch ^/despot/journal(.*) /var/www/despot/loathsxome.cgi$1

   Otherwise, if the configuration includes "AllowOverride all", you can
   put the following mod_rewrite rules in journal/.htaccess:

       Options FollowSymLinks
       RewriteEngine on
       RewriteRule /journal$ /despot/loathsxome.cgi [L]
       RewriteRule (.*) /despot/loathsxome.cgi/$1

   Either way, requests to anything under /despot/journal are rewritten
   to access loathsxome.cgi.

3. You need to create a data directory for Loathsxome, where the journal
   entries will live. Let us suppose you create /home/despot/loathsxome.
   You also need directories for plugins and plugin data, so create
   /home/despot/loathsxome/plugins and
   /home/despot/loathsxome/plugins/state too.

4. Edit loathsxome.cgi and set values in the "Configuration" section.
   You need to change $name and $description, set $url to the URL you
   want to publish (if you use mod_rewrite as described in step (2),
   you must set $url, otherwise you can set it to an empty string).
   Set $datadir etc. to the directories you created in step (3).

5. Copy plugins/bundle to the plugin directory, i.e.
   cp plugins/bundle /home/despot/loathsxome/plugins/

6. loathsxome.cgi fills in the built-in template components to generate
   the header, body, and footer of each page, but you can override this
   by creating template files in $datadir. For example, to override the
   built-in HTML components, create /home/despot/loathsxome/head.html,
   date.html, story.html, and foot.html.

   Look at the end of loathsxome.cgi (after __DATA__) to see what the
   built-in template components look like. You can edit these in-place
   instead of creating separate files, if you like.

7. Optional: If you intend to store journal entries in a git repository,
   you can use the included post-commit hook to add "meta: date=YMDHMS"
   lines to your posts and maintain an up-to-date cache of file entries.
   Copy scripts/post-commit to your .git/hooks directory and edit it to
   set the correct directory names. (If you're not using the default
   directory layout, you will need to edit the script a little more.
   Read the comments in the file.)

   Of course, you can also set up some other way to maintain the entry
   cache. See plugins/entrycache for more details.

A note on the documentation
---------------------------

I am aware that Loathsxome has inadequate documentation, and I consider
this a serious bug. The source code is well-documented, but there is no
user manual. I wrote the program for myself, at first with no intention
to release it, and later with no expectation that more than a few of my
friends would use it. But that is not an excuse for poor documentation,
and I would like to improve it.

Suggestions are welcome. Please let me know if you have questions about
any aspect of installing, using, or extending Loathsxome. I will try to
answer them and use the answers as the basis for better documentation.
(Knowing that the documentation would actually be useful to someone
would provide motivation to write it.)

In the meantime, the Blosxom documentation may be useful. Most of the
ideas translate directly, but the details may differ slightly. If you
are at all familiar with Perl, the source code may help to explain
those details. <http://blosxom.sourceforge.net/documentation/>
